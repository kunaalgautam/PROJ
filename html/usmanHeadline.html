    <h1> Who can Dethrone Usman? </h1>
    <p> 
        Kamaru “The Nigerian Nightmare” Usman is truly a spectacle of the welterweight 
        division. He is currently on a 19 fight winning streak and only has 1 loss. 
        He is unbeaten in the UFC and has knocked out top welterweight contenders including
        Colby Covington, Jorge Masvidal, and Gilbert Burns. Covington was expected to give 
        the hardest fight to Usman, yet Usman made easy work of him during their second 
        bout for a dominant unanimous decision win. Usman has always been known for his 
        spectacular wrestling, however he has recently been using a secret tool that has 
        given him notable recognition which is the jab. His front hand holds so much power
        and he was able to drop Covington and Burns with it on numerous occasions. His jab 
        keeps his opponents at distance, giving Usman the opportunity to counter or throw 
        other devastating strikes that the opponent cannot see. When it looks like theres 
        no one there to dethrone the welterweight king, who is there to look for as a 
        possible contender? Well, look no further than Khamzat “Borz” Chimaev, the 
        Swedish-Chechen nightmare for Usman. Khamzat recently participated in a 
        freestyle-wrestling contest with UFC middleweight Jack “the Joker” Hermannson
        where he completely dominated the bout for seven straight rounds. Hermannson is
        known for his wrestling and ground-game, and to see Chimaev (who was recently 
        brought into the UFC) derail him like that, brings about the question as to whether
        he can truly dethrone Usman. Khamzat not only has phenomenal wrestling in which he 
        choked out Li Jingliang recently in the first round, but his striking is not to be 
        overlooked. He was able to knockout Gerald Meerschaert in a mere 19 seconds. 
        Khamzat Chimaev could seriously pose a threat to the welterweight and middleweight
        divisions.
