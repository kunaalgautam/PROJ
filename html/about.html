        This webpage was developed by Kunaal Gautam. Kunaal is currently a senior attending Babson College in
        Wellesley, MASSACHUSSETS. He is pursuing a dual concentration in business analytics and marketing. Kunaal's 
        passion for business analytics grew after he took QTM 3 at Babson. In his spare time, Kunaal enjoys cooking, 
        reading, creating and filming movies, gaming, and participating in mixed martial arts. The purpose of this webpage 
        was ignited by Kunaal's fierce liking of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA). Ever since he was 5, he has been doing taekwondo,

        <h2> What is MMA? </h2>
   <p>
        Mixed Martial Arts is a full-combat sport that incorporates striking, grappling, wrestling, and ground-fighting. It is different 
        than boxing as it incorporates many other forms of combat. Over the past 20 years, the sport has evolved and become a worldwide 
        sensation of an activity. Many MMA promotions have reigned above all in terms of popularity, however the main focus of this webpage 
        will be of the two most current popular ones: the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) and Bellator. The sport itself can be very 
        complicated to understand but for those who do not understand it, here is a brief explanation. Fighters are divided into separate
        weight classes to make the matchups between fighters more fair. In the UFC, there are multiple weight classes: flyweight (125 lb), 
        bantamweight (135 lb), featherweight (145 lb), lightweight (155 lb), welterweight (170 lb), middleweight (185 lb), light heavyweight (205 lb), 
        and heavyweight (with the largest weight limit discrepancy of anywhere between 206 lb to 265 lb). Fighters must make the weight limit during 
        weigh ins which tend to be two days before fight day. If they are unable to make the proper weight requirement, then the fight could either be 
        cancelled or the fighter may have to forfeit their purse. Bellator MMA does not have a flyweight division. Normally, fights are scheduled for 3 
        5-minute rounds. However the fight can be stopped anytime during the fight and rounds if a fighter is knocked out unconscious (considered a KO), 
        if the fighter is repeatedly taking damage and unable to defend themselves (TKO), tap-out due to being choked or twisted (submission), or decision 
        (all rounds end And the judges score the contest). Each weight class has their own respective champions and rankings which will be shown in this web 
        page. Moreover, it is illegal to kick a grounded opponent anywhere above the waist. It is quite the spectacle!
