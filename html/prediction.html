    <h1> UFC 269 Poirier vs Oliviera  </h1>
    <p> 
        Our main event is underway as both Dustin Poirier and Charles Oliviera made weight today 
        on Friday. UFC 269 will take place in Las Vegas and is expected to be one of the highest 
        revenue generating PPV events of the year. The two lightweight contenders are expected to 
        put on a blast as Brazil’s Charles “Do Bronx” Oliviera (31-8) makes his first title defense
        against Louisiana’s Dustin “The Diamond” Poirier (28-6). Oliviera is expected to try and 
        take this fight to the ground, given his phenomenal jiu-jitsu. However, it is important to 
        understand that his striking is quite precise, as he was able to knockout “Iron” Michael 
        Chandler in his last bout that won him the championship belt. Poirier, when asked about 
        his odds as a challenger for the belt, explained how it is important to not doubt 
        Oliviera’s striking and ground-game. Poirier himself is quite talented in his ground-game 
        but expects to keep the fight standing to ensure his boxing skills reign and gives him the
        chance to knockout Oliviera. As of 12/10/2021, Poirier stands as the -160 favorite, and 
        Oliviera is the +140 underdog. The card is also expecting other big fighters to put on a 
        show including: Sean O’Malley, Amanda Nunes, Cody Garbrandt, Tai Tuivasa. Place your bets
