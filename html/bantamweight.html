    <h1> Possible Bantamweight Contender? </h1>
    <p> 
        UFC Vegas 44 ended with a bang as Jose Aldo dominated Rob Font for five whole 
        rounds, giving him the unanimous decision. This poses the question whether or 
        not Jose Aldo has redeemed himself for another title shot. His last opportunity 
        was on July 11, 2020 at UFC 251 where he lost by TKO to Petr “No Mercy” Yan. 
        Aldo utilized his leg kicks and precise but powerful striking to stun and hurt 
        Font on numerous occasions throughout the fight. Although, Font returned with 
        some big shots of his own, it was quite clear who was leading and dominating the
        entire fight. Font had been the favorite leading up to the fight, but I guess the
        underdog took the steal. I believe Aldo should fight another top contender before
        being given the opportunity to fight for the belt. Some possible contenders include
        TJ Dillashaw or Cory Sandhagen. Whether he can beat Yan again is a question that we
        must see until Aldo faces either of these two.
