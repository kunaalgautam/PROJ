    <h1> Teixeira given key to Danbury </h1>
    <p> 
        In a touching and deserved moment, new UFC light heavyweight champion Glover 
        Teixeira attended a parade thrown in his honor at his hometown of Danbury, 
        Connecticut. The champion recently got his belt after submitting Jan Blachowicz
        in round 2 at UFC 267 in Abu Dhabi. Despite being older than most of the UFC 
        roster at a bright age of 42 years, he was still able to conquer and beat the 
        best of the best in the light heavyweight division. Many believe that Teixeira 
        deserved to get the belt before he retires, and it made many people proud that
        he was able to achieve his dream of becoming champion. After the parade, Teixeira
        was awarded the key to the city of Danbury, in which he owns a gym. Rock on Glover!
        We are with you!
