    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
    <p>
      My website will discuss recent MMA news, show current rankings, and give
      people unfamiliar with the sport a chance to understand it. I want them to
      be able to appreciate the sport despite the negative reputation that it
      has.
    </p>
    <p>
      The objective of this website is to create new MMA fans who will
      appreciate the sport and begin to follow it. Another objective is to
      clarify any misunderstandings that people have about the sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since this is a web page that is open to everyone, my target audience
      would include both fans of MMA and those who are not.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will include a homepage that has an introduction that explains the sport
      to those unfamiliar with the sport. I will also have an about me page that
      explains the creator of the page and gives a brief background about me. I
      will have a standings page that shows current rankings of fighters in
      different weight classes in the UFC (I am choosing the UFC as it is the
      most popular MMA promotion company). I will include a news page that
      displays current news about the sport including future matchups,
      call-outs, important interviews etc. There will be a page that also
      explains the history of the sport so viewers can see how successful the
      sports expansion has been over the past 20 years. I will also add a blog
      page where I discuss fights, announcements, news and give my opinions on
      them.
